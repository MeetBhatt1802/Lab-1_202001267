## Q1. Identify FRs and NFRS

### <u>Functional Requirements</u>:
- student / employee login &nbsp;(user login)
    - Borrowing a book.
    - Returning a book.
    - Extend return data.
    - If a book has previously been borrowed by another person, then marked it as borrowed.

- library staff login &nbsp;(staff login)
    - Incomplete borrow requests can be shown here.
    - Incomplete return requests can be shown here.
    - Obtaining the list of books currently available at the library.
    - Searching/browsing a book to locate it on a shelf.

- librarian login &nbsp;(admin login)
    - Enter new record corresponding to the purchase of a book.
    - Delete a record if any book is taken off the shelf.

- Free browsing/searching of books for non-members (users not logged in)

- Issueing or returning book(s) requires user to login.

- The final product should be a web application running only on the institute LAN.

- All confidential information should be encrypted before storing.


### <u>Non-Functional Requirements</u>:
- Scalability
    - The system will be used by a big number of employees as well as research researchers, thus it will need to be adapted to manage such a big user base.

- Authentication
    - Before requesting to borrow, return, or extend a deadline for a book, a user must log into the system. The system must make sure that no user's login information is accessed and illegally misused to borrow or return books.

- Reliability
    - The database needs to be updated regularly to prevent errors like showing a book as available when it is actually unavailable (borrowed but not returned) or showing a book as borrowed by a user when that user has already returned the book.
    - ensuring that the user can only take out books that are currently available and that they can only be returned after they have been borrowed it.

- Maintainability
    - The web application can be easily modified and updated even if the development team responsible for the website changes, ensuring that the technology employed does not become out of date too rapidly.

## Q2. Identify scope, features, and non-functional aspects of the following problem

### <u>Scope</u>:
- The application's target audience is the 5% of the global population who have significant hearing loss. As they are the ones for whom the app is being built, these individuals would be the target audience for this app.

### <u>Features</u>:
- Low latency to enable real-time use.

- Alerts to user about the incoming sounds.

- The sounds recorded must also be logged properly in readable format.

- a real-time speech-to-text converter that would enable more effective conversation participation.

### <u>Non-Funcitonal Aspects</u>:
- To ensure that users of various age groups can read the text without difficulty, the text's font size should be changeable.

- To prevent misuse of such a log, the conversation log should be cleared routinely.
